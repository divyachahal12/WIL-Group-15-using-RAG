# WIL-Group-15-using-RAG

 Our team developed EcoWatt AI, an intelligent question-answering chatbot designed to assist
 Victorian households in understanding and accessing renewable energy incentives. The project’s
 primary goal is to support the Victorian Government’s sustainability agenda by promoting
 greater adoption of solar panels, batteries, and water heater systems through clear, trustworthy,
 and user-friendly information delivery.
 
 EcoWatt AI leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that retrieves
 relevant government documents and generates concise, citation-backed responses. This ensures
 users receive reliable information drawn directly from official sources rather than unverified
 claims. The prototype was implemented using a curated corpus of energy-related publications
 and tested for performance, accuracy, and user trust.
 
 The impact of EcoWatt AI lies in its potential to increase awareness and utilisation of
 underused government rebate programs. By simplifying access to verified data about incentives,
 the system can encourage more Victorians to adopt renewable energy technologies, reducing
 grid dependency, cutting household electricity costs, and contributing to Australia’s net-zero
 emission goals by 2050. The project not only benefits citizens but also supports local clean
 energy industries by stimulating market demand.
 
 Ethical and privacy principles guided every phase of development. The team ensured that
 only verified sources were indexed, user data was never stored, and all system outputs remained
 transparent and reproducible. Safety mechanisms were included to prevent hallucinations, mis
representation, and the use of untrusted content.

From a project management perspective, the team followed a structured yet lightweight Agile
 workflow using tools such as Trello for task tracking, GitHub for version control, Overleaf for
 documentation, and Microsoft Teams for weekly meetings. Each member had clearly defined
 roles, and contributions were tracked through commits, meeting notes, and progress updates to
 ensure accountability and collaboration.
 
 Looking forward, our team has outlined several actionable next steps, including expanding
 the annotated question bank, scaling human evaluations, enhancing UI accessibility, and con
ducting user testing across a diverse demographic. Further improvements will involve corpus
 expansion, policy alignment, and potential partnerships with industry bodies like the Clean
 Energy Council to ensure scalability and long-term adoption.
 
 In summary, EcoWatt AI represents a practical and socially beneficial application of data
 science and AI. Through our collaborative effort, we demonstrated how technology can drive sus
tainable behaviour, empower households with accurate knowledge, and contribute meaningfully
 to Victoria’s renewable energy transformation
